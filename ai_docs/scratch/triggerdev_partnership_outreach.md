**Date:** October 25, 2024
**Purpose:** Partnership outreach for Skribo.ai template integration with Trigger.dev
**Target Contacts:** Matt Aitken (CEO) and Eric Allam (CTO)

## Email Draft

### Subject Line
**shipkit.ai + Trigger.dev Partnership Opportunity**

### Email Body

Hi Matt and Eric,

I'm Brandon Hancock. I run a YouTube channel (@aiwithbrandon) where I teach developers how to build AI applications (around 80k subscribers), and I'm the founder of shipkit.ai, a platform that helps developers ship AI applications in days instead of months with production ready boilerplate projects.

The most requested project type from our 200+ paying customers is long running background jobs. Everyone wants to build AI workflows or regular long running jobs that take minutes or hours to complete, whether it's for their own startups or freelance client projects. Things like transcription pipelines, video processing, data analysis jobs, etc.

I'm building a new boilerplate project centered around Trigger.dev. This will become the go to starter project for anyone in shipkit.ai who wants to build long running job based applications, which means pretty much everyone using it will be signing up for Trigger.dev accounts.

shipkit.ai is continually growing every week, and these are active builders who are trying to ship real products. I was wondering if there's anything you could offer as an extra bonus for customers who sign up through shipkit.ai, like an extended free tier with higher usage limits, or their first month free on the Hobby plan, or something along those lines.

I think this could work well for both of us. Happy to chat more if you're interested.

Also, if not, totally understand. Absolutely love what you guys are working on, and if there's anything I can ever help out with, please let me know.

Brandon
